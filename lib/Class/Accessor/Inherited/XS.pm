=head1 NAME

Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS - fast XS inherited accessors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #install accessors at compile time
  use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS 
      inherited => [qw/foo bar/], # here key names are equal to accessor names
  ;
  
  use Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS {
      inherited => {
        bar => 'bar_key',
        foo => 'foo_key',
      },
  };
  
  #or in a Class::Accessor::Grouped-like fashion
  __PACKAGE__->mk_inherited_accessors('foo', ['bar', 'bar_key']);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides very fast implementation for 'inherited' accessors, that were introduced 
in L<Class::Accessor::Grouped>. They give you capability to override values set in a parent
class with values set in childs or object instances. Generated accessors are compatible with
L<Class::Accessor::Grouped> generated ones.

Since this module focuses primary on speed, it provides no capability to have your own per-class
getters/setters logic (like overriding L<get_inherited>/L<set_inherited> in L<Class::Accessor::Grouped>).

=head1 UTF-8

Starting with perl 5.16.0, this module provides full support for UTF-8 method names and hash 
keys. Before that, you can't distinguish UTF-8 strings from bytes string in method names, only in 
hash keys. You have been warned.

=head1 THREADS

Though highly discouraged, perl threads are supported by L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS>. You may
have accessors with the same names pointing to differents keys in different threads, etc. There are 
no known conceptual leaks.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> is 5-12x times faster than L<Class::Accessor::Grouped>, depending
on your usage pattern. Accessing data from a parent in large inheritance chain is still the worst case,
but even there L<Class::Accessor::Inherited::XS> beats L<Class::Accessor::Grouped> best-case.

Here are results from the benchmark run on perl 5.20.1 (see bench folder):
